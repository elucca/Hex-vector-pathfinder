# Week 1 progress report

## What has happened
- Project setup, including version control
- Project specification written

I've spent most of the time this week getting a grasp on the nature of the problem I'm tackling and deciding on possibly ways to solve it, as detailed in the project specification. No code has yet been written.

## Questions
- What specific algorithms are actually useful for this project? Further exploration is required.
- Is my current thinking of the nature of the problem and how to solve it correct?

## Next week
- Further thinking of the problem
- A basic implementation in code of some relevant algorithm, probably Dijkstra

Time spent: ~6 hours
